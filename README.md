# MSX KCX Bluetooth Transmitter


## MSX KCX V1.7
Add a bluetooth Music transmitter for all MSX. No driver needed !

* Bluetooth module 1.7
* mono with the internal pin 49 (Sony and Turbo-r need the jack input)
* Stereo mode with the input jack 3.5 
* low power consumption
* PCB Enig (recommanded)
* I/O cartridge. Can be used in all slot ;)


## How it works:
first, the BT module need to pair. it can take 1mn or more. push the button to try again if it doesn't work.
It's not necessary to pair again next time. the pairing is saved



> [!WARNING]
> Take care when soldering the bluetooth module. The pins are very thin. I am not responsible for any damage caused. This PCB has been carefully tested by me and works perfectly.
